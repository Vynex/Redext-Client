### Demo ðŸ’»

### Motivation ðŸ–Š

After spending about a month learning React, I wanted to build a Full Stack Project to showcase my skills. Since I personally use Reddit a lot, it was my first choice to try and clone. I only allowed Selftext Posts which is how it got the name Redext from *Reddit + Text*.

There are plenty of things that can be improved but I consider the project to be in a finished state as of now.
